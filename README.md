# evm-abi
Central repository for common abis that are commonly defined with the `sol!` macro from `alloy-rs` and their respective addresses.

I typically found myself hunting down the same abis every time I started a new project so this simplifies the process a bit. If you have an ABI to add, use your discretion to categorize it properly and open a PR :)
